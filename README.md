## Installing the app
Please note that GlucoseFit should not be solely relied on for your needs. Always consult your doctor
or care team when making changes to your routine. GlucoseFit is also fairly new, and there may still be
bugs in the app. With these in mind, the instructions for installing are as follows.

1. Go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/crazymisterno/GlucoseFit-Android/releases)
2. In the "Assets" section of the latest release listing, download the `.apk` file.
3. Open the downloads menu in your browser (the steps to do this may vary depending on your browser)
4. Select the newly downloaded apk.
5. You may get a message saying that your browser is not allowed to install unknown apps. When this
appears, select "settings"
6. Check the switch "Allow from this source"
   - Always be sure that the apps you install are safe before installing them.
7. You should receive a prompt asking if you want to install GlucoseFit. Select "Install"
   - If you do not see the prompt, open your browser and repeat steps 3 and 4

At this point, GlucoseFit is now installed on your device and ready to use.
